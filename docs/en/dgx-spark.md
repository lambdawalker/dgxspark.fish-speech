# DGX Spark setup

This fork adds a native Linux ARM64 installation for the DGX Spark's GB10 GPU.
The model and inference code are unchanged. Dependency resolution has been
checked for Linux ARM64 / Python 3.12; installation, audio decoding, GPU kernels,
and end-to-end speech generation still need validation on an actual Spark.

## Selected dependencies

| Package | Version | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | 3.12 | System Python or uv-managed Python |
| torch | 2.10.0 | Official PyTorch cu130 index |
| torchaudio | 2.10.0 | Official PyTorch cu130 index |
| torchcodec | 0.10.0 | Official PyTorch cu130 index |

PyTorch 2.9 does provide CUDA 13 ARM64 wheels. However, TorchAudio 2.9+ uses
TorchCodec for `torchaudio.load`, which Fish Speech uses for reference audio.
The TorchCodec 0.8/0.9 wheels compatible with PyTorch 2.9 do not include Linux
ARM64 in the checked PyPI, CPU, cu128, and cu130 indexes. The 2.10/0.10 pair
provides official ARM64 wheels without a source build or an audio-loader rewrite.

The wheel supplies its CUDA runtime dependencies. The host still needs a working
NVIDIA driver compatible with CUDA 13. `nvidia-smi` reports driver capability;
`nvcc --version` reports the separately installed toolkit. Neither alone proves
that the Python environment has a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build.

## Install

Run these commands on the Spark, in this repository. Install
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) first if needed.

```bash
uname -m                       # expected: aarch64
nvidia-smi                     # must detect the GB10
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential python3-dev portaudio19-dev libsox-dev libsndfile1 ffmpeg

uv sync --locked --python 3.12 --extra cu130
```

This creates/updates the project's `.venv`, not your global Python environment.
Keep `--extra cu130` on subsequent `uv run` and `uv sync` commands; otherwise uv
can switch back to a different Torch build. Do not combine it with `stable`,
`cpu`, `cu126`, `cu128`, or `cu129`, and do not use `--all-extras`.

Use uv for this setup: pip does not read `[tool.uv.sources]`, the extra conflicts,
or the existing protobuf override. A plain `pip install -e '.[cu130]'` does not
reproduce the locked environment. The older backend extras remain pinned to
Torch 2.8.0; `stable` explicitly selects the upstream 2.8 stack. A bare install
without an extra is not the Spark setup.

## Verify CUDA and reference-audio decoding

Run this before downloading the model. It prints the environment, runs actual
CUDA operations, and decodes a generated WAV from both a path and memory using
the same TorchAudio API used by Fish Speech. It needs no checkpoints.

```bash
uv run --locked --extra cu130 python - <<'PY'
import io
import platform
import tempfile
import wave
from pathlib import Path

import torch
import torchaudio
import torchcodec

print("Architecture:", platform.machine())
print("Python:", platform.python_version())
print("Torch:", torch.__version__)
print("TorchAudio:", torchaudio.__version__)
print("TorchCodec:", torchcodec.__version__)
print("CUDA runtime:", torch.version.cuda)
assert torch.cuda.is_available(), "CUDA unavailable: check driver and selected extra"
print("GPU:", torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))
print("Capability:", torch.cuda.get_device_capability(0))
print("Wheel architectures:", torch.cuda.get_arch_list())
assert torch.version.cuda == "13.0", "Expected a cu130 Torch build"
x = torch.randn(256, 256, device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
y = x @ x.T
assert torch.isfinite(y).all().item()
q = torch.randn(1, 2, 64, 64, device="cuda", dtype=torch.bfloat16)
z = torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention(q, q, q)
assert torch.isfinite(z).all().item()
torch.cuda.synchronize()
print("CUDA BF16 matmul and attention: OK")

with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as directory:
    path = Path(directory) / "probe.wav"
    with wave.open(str(path), "wb") as wav:
        wav.setnchannels(1)
        wav.setsampwidth(2)
        wav.setframerate(16000)
        wav.writeframes(b"\x00\x00" * 1600)
    for source in (str(path), io.BytesIO(path.read_bytes())):
        audio, rate = torchaudio.load(source)
        assert rate == 16000 and tuple(audio.shape) == (1, 1600)
print("Reference audio decoding (file and bytes): OK")
PY

## Download and run

```bash
uv run --locked --extra cu130 hf download fishaudio/s2-pro --local-dir checkpoints/s2-pro
uv run --locked --extra cu130 python tools/run_webui.py --device cuda
```

Open the local URL printed by Gradio (normally `http://127.0.0.1:7860`).
For a remote Spark, forward port 7860 over SSH from your desktop, for example
`ssh -L 7860:127.0.0.1:7860 spark@YOUR_SPARK`, then open that URL locally.

First generate speech without reference audio; then try a short WAV reference
and its transcript. The first command deliberately omits `--compile` so that
basic GPU execution is checked before Triton compilation. After both succeed,
you can try:

```bash
uv run --locked --extra cu130 python tools/run_webui.py --device cuda --compile
```

Compilation is a separate, unverified step and may have GB10/Triton-specific
issues. If only compilation fails, omit `--compile` while investigating it.

### Start script (LAN access, compiled inference)

After setup and downloading the checkpoints, run:

```bash
./start.sh
```

The script enables `--compile`, listens on `0.0.0.0`, and disables public Gradio
sharing, including any inherited `GRADIO_SHARE=True` setting. Open
`http://<SPARK_LOCAL_IP>:7860` from another device on your local network; use
`hostname -I` on the Spark to find its address. Stop the server with Ctrl+C.

The compilation cache defaults to `$HOME/.cache/fish-speech/inductor` and can be
overridden with `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR`. Cached artifacts can reduce subsequent
startup time; warm-up and recompilation may still occur. The script can be
launched from another directory and forwards extra WebUI arguments unchanged.

For the API instead of Gradio:

```bash
uv run --locked --extra cu130 python tools/api_server.py --device cuda --listen 127.0.0.1:8080
```

## If anything fails

Send the failing command, full traceback, `nvidia-smi` output, and the diagnostic
output above. For install failures, also include `uv --version`. If TorchCodec
cannot load its shared libraries, include `ffmpeg -version`; Ubuntu's FFmpeg
shared libraries must be available. A warning that the TorchAudio `backend`
argument is ignored is expected with 2.9+; installing SoundFile alone does not
replace TorchCodec in these versions.

This guide covers native installation. Existing Docker/Compose defaults still
describe the upstream CUDA 12 environment and are not a validated Spark path.
